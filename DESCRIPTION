Description: This package contains a few functions to make manipulation of object attributes easier. 
    It also contains a few functions that extend the 'dplyr' package for data manipulation, 
    and it provides a pipe operator '%at>%' similar to the magrittr '%>%', but with the 
    additional functionality to enable attributes propagation.
