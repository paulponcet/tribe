Description: Functions to make manipulation of object attributes easier. 
    It also contains a few functions that extend the 'dplyr' package for data 
    manipulation, and it provides new pipe operators, including the pipe '%@>%' 
    similar to the 'magrittr' '%>%', but with the additional functionality to 
    enable attributes propagation.
