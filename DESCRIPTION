Description: Functions to make manipulation of object attributes easier. 
    It also contains a few functions that extend the 'dplyr' package for data 
    manipulation, and it provides a pipe operator '%@>%' similar to the 
    magrittr '%>%', but with the additional functionality to enable attributes 
    propagation.
